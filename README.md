# mini_project_lstm_NLP
 **Development of an Intelligent Chatbot with LSTM and Reinforcement Learning**

Description:

A project in Natural Language Processing (NLP) aimed at developing a chatbot capable of understanding and responding to natural language queries. The model uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network architecture to analyze data sequences and their long-term dependencies. In the future, the integration of reinforcement learning techniques is planned to enhance response accuracy and adaptability of the user experience.
